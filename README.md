# SaaSDesignPatterns

This is a repository of sass design patterns - not best practices necessarily, but a collection of techniques, tools, and design patterns to inspire you to get things done, show how other apps have done things, and remind you how you've done it successfully in the past. 

## Examples:

- Dashboard layout
- Admin backends & admin namespace
- Member-only sections
- Login screens
- Database structure
- Pricing models
- Multi-tenancy
- CSS frameworks
- Javascript frameworks

Each section would have several different examples and a commentary on each.

Articles are not meant to be code-complete, or even a walkthrough, but merely to give a visual overview of each pattern.
