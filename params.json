{"name":"SaaS Design Patterns","tagline":"Get that app done","body":"# SaaS Design Patterns\r\n\r\nThis is a repository of sass design patterns - not best practices necessarily, but a collection of techniques, tools, and design patterns to inspire you to get things done, show how other apps have done things, and remind you how you've done it successfully in the past. \r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n- Dashboard layout\r\n- Admin backends & admin namespace\r\n- Member-only sections\r\n- Login screens\r\n- Database structure\r\n- Pricing models\r\n- Multi-tenancy\r\n- CSS frameworks\r\n- Javascript frameworks\r\n\r\nEach section would have several different examples and a commentary on each.\r\n\r\nArticles are not meant to be code-complete, or even a walkthrough, but merely to give a visual overview of each pattern. \r\n\r\n## Resources:\r\n\r\n- \"Patterns are a widely used concept in computer science to describe good solutions to reoccurring problems in an abstract form.‚Äù http://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/\r\n\r\n## Contributing:\r\n\r\nFeel free to [edit the wiki](https://github.com/mysmallidea/SaaSDesignPatterns/wiki) and add your favorite app design patterns.
